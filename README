I. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================

Minimal system requirements
---------------------------

    1.  Web server with support for  PHP version 4.0.6 or better  (PHP5 is also
        supported).

        Make sure the configuration file php.ini meets the following requirements:
        a. safe_mode must be disabled
        b. file_uploads must be enabled
        c. register_long_arrays must be enabled (only for hosts using PHP5; not
           required for PHP4)

        (all these values are default)

    2.  The web server must have support for MySQL databases.
        X-Cart  is compatible with  MySQL versions from 3.23.  You will need to
        have access to  a MySQL database,  so make sure  you have the following
		information: your MySQL server name, your database name,  your username
		and password for MySQL access.

    3.  The server perfomance,  recommended for X-Cart to run on it, depends on
        how many visitors your store will have. Unpacked distribution of X-Cart
        requires about 3 megabytes of disk space,  but you may need more if you
        are going to use additional files and own templates for X-Cart.

    4.  The  database size used by  X-Cart depends on  the number of  products,
        customers and orders stored in it.  For example, for small shops it may
        be 1 megabyte, for medium 10, and for huge stores over 100 megabytes.

Advanced requirements and recommended settings
----------------------------------------------

Certain parts of X-Cart's functionality rely on using external files.
Accordingly,  your web server must be allowed  to run external executable files
(like Perl) and  to make outgoing connections to the Internet (that is required
for online payments). 

The following components may be required: 

    1.  An  HTTPS module (like Net::SSLeay perl  module, CURL executable, OpenSSL
        executable  or libCURL PHP extension)  for some of the online credit card
        processing modules and for shipping modules.

    2.  EXPAT extension for PHP for Intershipper, UPS or USPS shipping modules.

Make sure the functions  "exec", "popen", "pclose" and "ini_set" are not included
in the disabled functions list in php.ini:

    1.  PHP function "exec()" must be allowed for the correct functioning of most
        of  the  CC payment  processing  modules  used  with  X-Cart  (CyberCash,
        CyberPac (LaCaixa), VeriSign PayFlow Pro, PayBox, CyberSource, PaySystems
        Client, VaultX),  HTTPS modules  (Net::SSLeay, CURL, OpenSSL, https_cli),
        GnuPG/PGP, X-Carts Patch/Upgrade functionality.

    2.  PHP functions  "popen()"  &  "pclose()"  must  be  allowed for the correct
        functioning  of  some  HTTPS modules  (CURL, Net::SSLeay), payment modules
        (Saferpay, CyberSource, iDeb), shipping modules (DHL/Airborne, Canada Post,
        UPS Online Tools, Intershipper, AntiFraud module.

    3.  PHP function  "ini_set()"  is  used for the session mechanism and enhances
        security.

For help on this visit the PHP site at http://www.php.net

An SSL certificate is highly recommended to ensure security of online transactions
at your store. You can obtain a certificate using our "Security products" section.

Note:  The above-listed  requirements  are usually  met by all web hosting service
providers. If unsure, contact your provider for details.


II. INSTALLATION
================

For detailed instructions  on  installation refer  to INSTALL  file  in  X-Cart
directory.


III. COMMENTS FOR DEVELOPER
===========================

There are several ways to customize the look and feel of X-Cart:

1. You can modify the Smarty-templates. Use either FTP or the "Edit templates"
or "Webmaster mode" features to do that.
You can refer to http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/ to learn more about Smarty.

2. You can modify the color scheme by editing the '<xcart-dir>/skin1/skin1.css'
file. Use either FTP or the "Edit templates" feature to do that.

3. You can re-upload the default images stored in the <xcart-dir>/skin1/images/
directory. Use either FTP or the "Edit templates" feature to do that.

4. Most of X-Cart texts are stored in the so-called "language variables".  You
can edit  the language  variables  under  the "Languages" section of the admin
interface.

You might want to modify the following templates:
skin1/customer/home.tpl  -  the main template, all other templates are directly
or indirectly included into this one.
skin1/customer/categories.tpl  -  the categories list on the left side  of the
screen.
skin1/customer/main/subcategories.tpl  -  the subcategories list in the central
space.
skin1/head.tpl  -  the header part of the screen.
